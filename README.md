# Using Reaktion

Based on these screenshots ~ http://www.keijiro.tokyo/projects/reaktion.html

The plugin features scripts classified in 3 categories :
- Injectors : For receiving the audio signals 
- Reaktor : For analyzing the signal
- Gears : For manipulating objects

For reference on how to setup these scripts to objects, check:
../ReaktionTest/Complex Motion.unity

### Notes

You will see that there is an audio input gameobject with an injector and reaktor script attached. There are many type of injector for receiving different audio signals. Use the appropriate one. However, there is only one reaktor script so keep using that one. Once you've finished setting that up. You need to setup your gear script on your objects that you want to affect. Like injectors, there are different types of scripts for gears that make the objects react in different ways.
